In nature, microorganisms live together and cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. As synthetic biology advances, we will inevitably transition from unicellular systems to engineering at the multicellular level. A major obstacle, however, is ensuring stable coexistence of different cell types in co-culture. To overcome this obstacle, a team of undergraduate students from Imperial College London's iGEM 2016 team created <a href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College" target="_blank">Ecolibrium</a>, a project which aimed to develop a Genetically Engineered Artificial Ratio (GEAR) system to control population ratios in microbial consortia.

A. L. I. C. E was developed concurrently to facilitate the design and optimization of co-cultures. On this platform, synthetic biologists can submit entries containing growth conditions, protocol and data for cell cultures as well as search entries that have been previously submitted. <a href="http://ecolibrium.eu.pn/sign-up-for-submission-privileges/">Obtain permission now</a> to actively submit new entries to A. L. I. C. E!
